# My dotfiles

Configuration files, scripts and modules I use with my [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) and [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) install :
- [Rofi](https://davatorium.github.io/rofi/) application launcher
- [Dunst](https://dunst-project.org/) notifications with volume, mic and brightness bars
- [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) to display system informations with bluetooth and wifi control
- [SDDM](https://github.com/sddm/sddm): Wayland display manager
- Media keys : volume, mic, brightness, lock, screenshot (+ screencast) and more
- Configurable theme switcher for GTK3, GTK4, qt5 and qt6 apps, Dunst, Rofi and wallpaper (using [hyprpaper](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprpaper/))
- GUI `iwd` manager (supports PSK, PWD, TLS, TTLS and PEAP)
